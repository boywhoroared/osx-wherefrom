# README

`wherefrom` is tool to print the sources (where the file came from) of a file.  

It's reason for existing is to help an **Automator**  workflow to move files
based on their source and type. Something of a DIY [Hazel.app](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) since I'm
unwilling to purchase that app right now, and also sheer curiosity as to it
may be accomplished :mag: :flashlight:

## SYNOPSIS

    wherefrom <file>

## EXAMPLES

    $ wherefrom ~/Downloads/illgotten-gains-from-shady-music-site.mp3
    "http://belowboard.davyjoneslocker.me"
